Passionate by new technologies and business, I enjoy keeping myself updated about digital/business trends and testing tools from the internet. I put a particular effort into delivering the best experience that my customer deserves and still learning everyday.

After graduading from [HETIC](https://www.hetic.net/), I made my own company [Coraye](https://www.coraye.com/) with 2 others co-founders.

During the episode of Covid-19, I applied for [Humind School](https://www.humindschool.com/), a ten-week intensive bootcamp where we learn all the science about B2B Sales.

Today, I'm looking for new sales management opportunities and hope to work on challenging and meaningful projects.
