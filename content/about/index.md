Passionate by new technologies and business, I'm enjoying myself keep updated about digital/business trends, testing things from the internet and making some deals. I put a particular effort into delivering the best experience that my customer deserves and still learning everyday.

After graduading from [HETIC](https://www.hetic.net/), I made my own company [Coraye](https://www.coraye.com/) with 2 others associates.

During the tragedic episode of Covid-19, I apply for [Humind School](https://www.humindschool.com/) a ten weeks-intensive bootcamp where we learn all the science about B2B Sales.

Today, I'm looking for new sales management opportunities in sales management and hope to work on challenging and meaningful projects.
